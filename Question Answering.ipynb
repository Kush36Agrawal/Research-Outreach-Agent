    "Join patterns provide a promising approach to the development of concurrent and distributed message-passing applications. Several variations and implementations have been presented in the literature - but various aspects remain under-explored: in particular, how to specify a suitable notion of message matching, how to implement it correctly and efficiently, and how to systematically evaluate the implementation performance.\n",
    "In this work we focus on actor-based programming, and study the application of join patterns with conditional guards (i.e., the most expressive and challenging version of join patterns in literature). We formalise a novel specification of fair and deterministic join pattern matching, ensuring that older messages are always consumed if they can be matched. We present a stateful, tree-based join pattern matching algorithm and prove that it correctly implements our fair and deterministic matching specification. We present a novel Scala 3 actor library (called JoinActors) that implements our join pattern formalisation, leveraging macros to provide an intuitive API. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our implementation, by introducing a systematic benchmarking approach that takes into account the nuances of join pattern matching (in particular, its sensitivity to input traffic and complexity of patterns and guards).\n",

      "The authors propose a novel approach to join pattern matching for actor-based programming, ensuring fair and deterministic matching of messages. They formalize a specification for fair and deterministic join pattern matching, develop a stateful tree-based algorithm, and implement it in a Scala 3 actor library called JoinActors. The authors also introduce a systematic benchmarking approach to evaluate the performance of their implementation, taking into account the nuances of join pattern matching.\n"
